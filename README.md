# AND101 Lab 3 - Spotify Clone

Submitted by: Marisol Morales

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Summary

We started off with an emptyviewproject and focused on editting our empty app that originally displays simply a "Hello World" to resemble a Spoitfy Log in screen on their mobile app. 

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üòº üñêÔ∏è üíØ


## Video Demo

Here's a video / GIF that demos all of the app's implemented features:
